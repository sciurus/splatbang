This is a catchall repository for tracking handy scripts too simple to justify their own repository.

 * ping\_instance: report reachability of an oracle instance
 * ping\_server: report reachability of a server

 * scan\_port: report reachability of service listening on a TCP port
 * socks: simplifies setup of port forwarding via ssh SOCKS proxy
